# AI Image Generator

This is a simple React application that leverages the **Imagen 3.0** model from Google's Generative AI to generate images based on text prompts.

---

## Features

* **Text-to-Image Generation**: Input a descriptive text prompt and get a unique image generated by AI.
* **Loading States**: Visual feedback during image generation.
* **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages for API errors or invalid prompts.
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
* **Modal Notifications**: Informative pop-up messages for user guidance and errors.

---

## Technologies Used

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **Google Generative AI (Imagen 3.0)**: The AI model used for image generation.
* **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the AI model API.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ai-image-generator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Obtain a Google Cloud API Key

To use the Imagen 3.0 model, you'll need an API key from Google Cloud.

* Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
* Create a new project or select an existing one.
* Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
* Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key".
* **Restrict your API key** to prevent unauthorized use. You should restrict it by HTTP referrers (web sites) to your application's domain. Also, restrict it to the Generative Language API.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

The API key is injected by your environment. In a typical React setup, you would use a `.env` file for this. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project:

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with the API key you obtained in the previous step.

**Important**: Do not commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore` by default for create-react-app projects.

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1.  Enter a descriptive prompt in the input field (e.g., "A hyperrealistic painting of a cat wearing a spacesuit looking at Earth from the moon").
2.  Press `Enter` or click the "**Generate Image**" button.
3.  The application will display a loading indicator while the image is being generated.
4.  Once complete, your unique AI-generated image will appear!
